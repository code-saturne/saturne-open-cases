The meshing scripts in this directory have been generated by the Salome
platform's SMESH module, using interactive meshing, followed by a Python dump
of the study, then edited.

The scripts were initially generated with Salome 7.2, and have been tested with
versions up to 9.7.

The "staggered_base.py" script should be loaded by Salome first, so as to
generate a 2D base mesh. The top part may be edited so as to generate a (much)
coarser version if required.
The "staggered_base_extrude.py" should be used afterwards, so as to extrude
the mesh over a chosen number of layers. The top part may be edited so
as to change the number of layers.

The "staggered_border_base.py" and "staggered_side_extrude.py" scripts are
similar, and allow generating side meshes for the computational domain,
representing the parts of a mock-up near the containing walls. They are not
currently used in the benchmark meshes.
